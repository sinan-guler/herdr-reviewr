//! herdr-reviewr — a herdr-native review pane.
//!
//! Browse an agent's changes (uncommitted / branch), leave line-range comments,
//! and send them back to the agent (or the clipboard) — entirely in a herdr pane.
//!
//! This crate is split into a thin binary (`src/main.rs`) and this library so the
//! interaction logic in [`app`] stays terminal-free and unit-testable. This module
//! owns the terminal lifecycle and the event loop; it maps input events onto
//! [`app::App`] methods and renders with [`ui`].
