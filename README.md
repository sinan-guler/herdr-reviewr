A code-review pane for [herdr](https://herdr.dev). Your agent writes the code. You read its
diff in a pane beside the chat, comment on the lines, and send the notes back. You never leave
the terminal.

![demo](assets/demo.gif)

One persistent pane, pointed at a git worktree:

- **Diff review** — the agent's changed files, syntax-highlighted.
- **Four diff scopes** — uncommitted, branch, last turn, commits.
- **Last-turn diff** — what the worktree's latest turn changed, on its own.
- **Line comments** — comment on a line or a range. Then send it to the agent.
- **Text selection** — drag over any text to copy it, like an editor.
- **File viewer** — any file's current content from the whole worktree.
- **Search** — fuzzy file names and live code grep across the worktree, powered by [fff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/fff).
- **Find in file** — search the open file and step between every match.
- **PR view** — the branch's pull request in the pane, read-only.
- **Markdown preview** — flip a `.md` file between source and rendered view.
- **Themes** — 18 palettes in dark and light.

It never edits your files and sends nothing on its own. The only thing it writes is git's
index, and only when you press the review key yourself. The **PR** tab reads GitHub, GitLab,
or Azure DevOps and never posts.

## Requirements

- **herdr ≥ 0.7.5** (the plugin system).
- **git** on `PATH`.
- A **truecolor** terminal with Unicode box-drawing.
- **macOS or Linux.**
- **`gh`** (GitHub), **`glab`** (GitLab), or **`az`** (Azure DevOps, with the `azure-devops` extension), authenticated. Only the **PR** tab needs one.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries, no Rust toolchain needed:

```bash
herdr plugin install sinan-guler/herdr-reviewr
```

Open it in the current workspace:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke open --plugin sinan-guler.reviewr
```

reviewr auto-opens when herdr creates a workspace for a worktree, whether the checkout is new or
opened from disk. `auto_open = false` keeps it hidden until you ask
([Configuration](#configuration)).

**To update**, reinstall. Your config is keyed by plugin id and survives:

```bash
herdr plugin uninstall sinan-guler.reviewr && herdr plugin install sinan-guler/herdr-reviewr
```

**Without herdr**, reviewr runs as a plain terminal app. Grab a
[release binary](https://github.com/sinan-guler/herdr-reviewr/releases/latest) and point it at a
repo:

```bash
herdr-reviewr ~/some/repo
```

Everything works except **Send** and the **last turn** scope. Those need herdr around.

## Quick start

Open reviewr next to your agent:

1. **Pick a file.** Changed files are in the navigator. `j` / `k` moves, the diff follows. Or
   `]` walks the changes hunk by hunk, file after file.
2. **Focus the diff.** `Tab` switches panes.
3. **Select lines.** `v`, then `j` / `k` to extend (or click or drag the gutter).
4. **Comment.** `c`, type, `Enter`.
5. **Send.** `s` sends every comment to the agent's input.

The footer shows the next step. Press `?` for every key that works right now.

For a shortcut, bind a key to the toggle in your herdr config (user config, not the plugin manifest):

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "cmd+r"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "sinan-guler.reviewr.toggle"   # <plugin_id>.<action_id> — note the id, not the name
```

`cmd+…` chords reach herdr. Many macOS terminals swallow `alt+…` themselves.

## Controls

The keys below are defaults. You can rebind every action, even to several keys at once
([Keybindings](#keybindings)).

**Getting around**

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `1` `2` `3` | Switch tab — Changes / All files / PR |
| `u` `i` `b` `t` `g` | Switch scope — uncommitted / unstaged / branch / last turn / commits |
| `B` | Pick the base branch |
| `G` | Pick the commits to review |
| `j` `k` · `↑` `↓` | Move cursor |
| `]` `[` | Jump to next / previous hunk |
| `f` `F` | Jump to next / previous file |
| `PageUp` `PageDown` | Move a page |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Move a half-page |
| `Tab` | Switch focus |
| `→` `←` | Expand / collapse, or scroll sideways |
| `/` | Search files and code |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find in file |
| `w` | Toggle line wrap |
| `m` | Preview markdown file |
| `p` | Rotate navigator |
| `z` | Hide / show navigator |
| `<` `>` | Grow / shrink navigator |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `?` | Open shortcuts helper |
| `q` | Quit |

**Reviewing** (in the diff)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `a` `A` | Mark the file reviewed / take the mark back off |
| `v` | Select lines |
| `c` | Comment on line or selection |
| `e` | Edit the comment under the cursor, or open the file in your editor |
| `d` | Delete comment |
| `n` `N` | Jump to next / previous comment |
| `l` | List all comments |
| `s` | Send comments to agent |
| `y` | Copy comments to clipboard |
| `esc` | Clear selection |

**In the comment box**

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Save comment |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
| `Shift+Enter` · `Alt+Enter` · `Ctrl+J` | Insert newline |

Plus the usual caret moves: arrows, `Home` / `End`, `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+E`, `Alt+b` / `Alt+f` word
jumps, and `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+K` deletes.

**PR tab** (read-only)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` `k` | Move through description and comments |
| `PageUp` `PageDown` | Scroll focused pane |
| `o` | Open PR in browser |
| `r` | Refresh |

The mouse works too. Drag over any text to select and copy it, double-click a word,
triple-click a line. Click or drag the line-number gutter to comment. Click files, tabs, and
links, and scroll with the wheel.

## The three tabs

- **Changes** — the active scope's changed files with `+/-` stats and totals in the header.
- **All files** — any file's current content from the whole worktree, comments too. Ignored
  paths show dimmed.
- **PR** — a read-only mirror of the branch's pull request (GitHub, Azure DevOps) or merge
  request (GitLab): state, checks, description, and comments, rendered as markdown. reviewr
  never writes to the forge.

## Diff scopes

- **uncommitted** — the working tree vs `HEAD` (staged, unstaged, and untracked).
- **unstaged** — the working tree vs the **index**: everything you have not marked reviewed
  yet ([Marking files reviewed](#marking-files-reviewed)). Files leave as you mark them, so
  the list is your review queue and an empty one means you are done.
- **branch** — the working tree vs the merge-base with the base branch: **uncommitted** plus
  the branch's commits. The base is your repo's default branch until you pick another with
  `B` ([Base branch](#base-branch)).
- **last turn** — everything that changed in this worktree since its most recent turn started
  ([Limitations](#limitations)).
- **commits** — one commit, or several in a row, picked with `G`. Read what the agent
  committed one step at a time, without its unsaved edits mixed in.

reviewr starts in **uncommitted**. `default_scope` changes that. Switching with
`u`/`i`/`b`/`t`/`g` wins for the rest of the session. `g` without a pick opens the picker.

Every scope respects `.gitignore`, so build output never clutters **Changes**. To review a file,
track it. **All files** still browses any ignored path.

## Marking files reviewed

Press `a` on a file to mark it reviewed, `A` to take the mark back off. A mark is just
`git add`: reviewr stages the file, and the mark column at the left of the file list shows
where you are.

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| (blank) | Not looked at yet |
| `✓` | Reviewed |
| `◐` | Reviewed, and changed again since |

Because the mark lives in git's index, the **unstaged** scope is the other half of the same
idea: it diffs the index against the working tree, so it lists exactly what you have not
reviewed, and a file you already marked comes back carrying only what arrived after the mark.
Work down it until it is empty.

Nothing is committed for you — what to commit stays your call, and the marks are already
staged when you want to. Marking never touches file contents, branches, or `HEAD`.

Two files are left alone: a file with an unresolved merge conflict (staging one resolves the
conflict, so reviewr refuses), and anything in the **commits** scope, where both sides are
already committed and the index describes neither.

## Configuration

CLI flags on the pane command:

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--poll <ms>` | `2000` | worktree poll interval (min `200`) |
| `--base <ref>` | auto | base for `branch` scope, any rev, overrides the pick |
| `--theme <name>` | `catppuccin` | UI + syntax theme (see below) |
| `--wrap <on\|off>` | `on` | soft-wrap long diff lines (`w` toggles at runtime) |

Everything else lives in reviewr's config file:

```text
~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/sinan-guler.reviewr/config.toml
```

Create it if missing. It is reviewr's file. Settings in herdr's `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`
never reach it. reviewr re-reads it on every refresh and toggle, so edits apply without a
relaunch.

The file accepts these keys:

```toml
theme = "tokyo-night"
default_scope = "branch"
navigator_position = "right"
toggle_placement = "overlay"
toggle_direction = "down"
auto_open = false
github_host = "github.example.com"
editor = "code -g {file}:{line}"

[keybindings]
comment = ["c", "ㅊ"]
select  = ["v", "ㅍ"]
```

A missing file or omitted key uses its default. An invalid file is rejected whole — the pane
shows the error and recovers on the next refresh after you fix it.

### Theme

One theme colors the whole UI, chrome and syntax together:

```toml
theme = "tokyo-night"
```

`--theme` overrides the file. Match your terminal's light or dark background. Available:

- **Dark:** `catppuccin`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`, `dracula`, `nord`,
  `gruvbox`, `one-dark`, `solarized`, `monokai`, `tokyo-night`, `rose-pine`.
- **Light:** `catppuccin-latte`, `gruvbox-light`, `one-light`, `solarized-light`,
  `github-light`, `tokyo-night-day`, `rose-pine-dawn`.

Names match herdr's where both ship a palette.

### Navigator position

The navigator starts on the right. Set `navigator_position` to `right`, `bottom`, `left`, or
`top`, or press `p` to cycle clockwise:

```toml
navigator_position = "bottom"
```

`<` grows, `>` shrinks, or drag the divider. `z` hides the navigator altogether and brings it
back.

### Base branch

The **branch** scope diffs against the merge-base with your repo's default branch, the one
`origin/HEAD` names. The header shows the resolved base, `vs main`.

When the trunk is something else, or you review a stacked branch, press `B` (or click the
base name) and pick the branch. The pick is stored for this worktree and holds until you
pick again. Other worktrees on the same clone keep their own pick. Choosing the default
branch records that name.

You can also type any revision, like `HEAD~2`, a tag, or a SHA prefix. The header shows what
resolved: `vs HEAD~2 (a1b2c3d)`.

`--base <ref>` sets the base for this pane. It wins over the pick and disables the picker.

### Editor

`e` opens the file at the line you're on, or the navigator's selected file. On a line you have
already commented, `e` edits the comment instead.

Set `$EDITOR` (or `$VISUAL`) and reviewr opens it at the right line. It knows vim, neovim,
helix, emacs, nano, VS Code and its forks, Zed, Sublime Text, JetBrains, and the rest of the
usual set.

A terminal editor takes the pane, and reviewr refreshes when you quit it. A window editor opens
its own window, so the diff stays up and your save turns up in it on the next poll.

Write the command yourself when you need to. `{file}` and `{line}` are reviewr's, everything
else is your editor's:

```toml
editor = "code -g {file}:{line}"
```

### Keybindings

`[keybindings]` maps an action name to an array of keys. The array replaces that action's
defaults, actions you don't mention keep theirs, and hints show the first key:

```toml
[keybindings]
comment = ["c", "ㅊ"]
select  = ["v", "ㅍ"]
```

Several keys per action serves CJK input sources — bind the character your layout produces
on the same physical key.

The action names and their defaults:

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `down` / `up` | `j` / `k` |
| `next-hunk` / `prev-hunk` | `]` / `[` |
| `next-file` / `prev-file` | `f` / `F` |
| `scope-uncommitted` / `scope-unstaged` / `scope-branch` / `scope-last-turn` / `scope-commits` | `u` / `i` / `b` / `t` / `g` |
| `base-pick` / `commit-pick` | `B` / `G` |
| `tab-changes` / `tab-all-files` / `tab-pr` | `1` / `2` / `3` |
| `wrap` | `w` |
| `preview` | `m` |
| `navigator-position` | `p` |
| `navigator-hide` | `z` |
| `navigator-grow` / `navigator-shrink` | `<` / `>` |
| `select` | `v` |
| `stage` / `unstage` | `a` / `A` |
| `comment` | `c` |
| `edit` / `delete` | `e` / `d` |
| `next-comment` / `prev-comment` | `n` / `N` |
| `comments` | `l` |
| `search` | `/` |
| `find` | `ctrl+f` |
| `keys` | `?` |
| `send` | `s`, `S` |
| `copy` | `y`, `Y` |
| `open-pr` | `o` |
| `refresh` | `r` |
| `quit` | `q` |

A key is one printable character, or a `ctrl+`/`alt+` chord like `ctrl+f`. `Tab`, `Esc`, and
`Enter` are fixed. Keys still type normally in the comment box.

### Forge repositories and hosts

The PR tab reads `upstream` when you have one, otherwise `origin`. A standard fork clone works
without setup.

GitHub.com, GitLab.com, dev.azure.com, and the `*.visualstudio.com` organization hosts work
without configuration. For one self-hosted instance per forge, set its bare hostname:

```toml
github_host = "github.example.com"
gitlab_host = "git.corp.example"
azure_devops_host = "tfs.corp.example"
```

Matching is exact. reviewr does not infer SSH aliases like `github.com-work` — use a
canonical-host remote or an `insteadOf` rewrite. Authenticate with
`gh auth login --hostname github.example.com`, `glab auth login --hostname git.corp.example`,
or `az login`.

### Pane placement

The toggle opens reviewr as a split to the right of your agent. `toggle_placement` changes the
shape:

```toml
toggle_placement = "overlay"   # split | overlay | zoomed | tab   (default: split)
toggle_direction = "down"      # right | down — split only        (default: right)
```

- **`split`** sits next to your agent. `toggle_direction` puts reviewr on the right (default) or below.
- **`overlay`** covers the tab. Toggle again to drop back.
- **`zoomed`** fills the tab.
- **`tab`** opens its own tab.

Every placement takes the keyboard on toggle. New worktree workspaces auto-open only `split` and
`tab`, and never steal focus.

### Auto-open and layout plugins

reviewr auto-opens when herdr creates a workspace for a new or existing worktree checkout. Opening
an already-live workspace does not resurrect a reviewr pane you closed there. `auto_open = false`
makes it wait for the toggle:

```toml
auto_open = false   # default: true
```

A layout places reviewr like any other program. Give one pane the command:

```toml
command = "herdr-reviewr"
```

That pane is a full reviewr pane. The install links the binary at `~/.local/bin/herdr-reviewr`
and at `~/.local/state/herdr/plugins/sinan-guler.reviewr/bin/herdr-reviewr`. Use the long path
if `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`.

A layout hook can also invoke the actions, once its panes are in place:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke open --plugin sinan-guler.reviewr
```

`open` ignores `auto_open`, and both actions are safe to repeat. They target the focused
workspace. Put `herdr-reviewr` itself in a layout pane, never the invoke.

## Limitations

The known constraints:

**Terminal & theme**
- **Truecolor required** — colors are 24-bit RGB with no 256/8-color fallback. Basic terminals
  render wrong colors.
- **Theme must match the terminal** — the pane keeps the terminal's background, and there is no
  auto light/dark detection yet. You match the theme by hand.
- **Add / remove are red / green** — no secondary cue for colorblind users yet.
- **Box-drawing glyphs required**, but no Nerd Font.

**Platform**
- **macOS and Linux only** — no Windows.
- **Clipboard export** uses `pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, or `xsel`. With none installed it
  says so, and **Send** still works.

**herdr coupling**
- **Send needs an agent in the workspace** — one agent takes the comments straight away, and
  several open a picker so you choose. With no agent, Send says so and keeps your comments.
- **last turn relies on polling** (2 s default) — a turn that starts and finishes inside one
  poll is missed, and the scope shows everything since the last *observed* turn start, your
  own edits included.

**PR tab (GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps)**
- **Read-only** — needs the forge's authenticated CLI (`gh`, `glab`, or `az`) and a
  recognized `upstream` or `origin`. Without either it tells you what to fix, and the other
  tabs keep working. Other forges are not supported.
- **One repository, never a cross-repository search** — a readable, recognized `upstream` is
  authoritative, otherwise `origin`. Clones that target different parent repositories stay
  separate.
- **Mirrors the branch's *open* PR or MR** — merged or closed shows as history. Each comment
  surface caps at its newest 100 rows, with a `+more` marker naming the forge when there is
  more.

**Review model**
- **Comments are in-memory and single-session** — closing the pane loses any you haven't sent
  or copied out.
- **Sending is all-or-nothing** — Send (or copy) delivers the whole set and clears it. A
  failure leaves everything in place.
- **No line-number rebasing** — a comment stays locatable by its diff snippet, not its line
  number. reviewr flags a stale comment instead of dropping it.

**Budgets**
- Files over 2 MB or 50,000 lines show a "too large" notice. Binary files get no diff.

## Building from source

For the dev setup, tests, and benchmarks, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). To run your
own build inside herdr panes, link the checkout. `herdr plugin link` runs the binary you build
at `bin/herdr-reviewr`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinan-guler/herdr-reviewr
cd herdr-reviewr
just install   # build release → bin/herdr-reviewr, ad-hoc re-signed on macOS
herdr plugin link .
```

After every `just install`, toggle the reviewr pane off and on. An open pane keeps running the old
process. The loop only works while the plugin is linked: a `github:…` source in
`herdr plugin list` runs a downloaded binary that local rebuilds never touch. Switch with:

```bash
herdr plugin uninstall sinan-guler.reviewr   # config is keyed by id and survives
herdr plugin link .
```

## Roadmap

Structured (JSON) export, a side-by-side split view, mark-file-reviewed,
named-key notation for keybindings, OSC light/dark theme autodetect, more themes
(`kanagawa`, `vesper`, `everforest`, `ayu`, a dark `github`), a `terminal`-following palette,
and OSC 52 clipboard.
