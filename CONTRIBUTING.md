# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to make reviewr better. This page gets you from clone to merged PR.

## Setup

You need Rust (the exact toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` and installs itself on
first build) and [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinan-guler/herdr-reviewr
cd herdr-reviewr
just test          # the test suite
just run           # run reviewr against this repo
cargo run -- ~/some/repo   # or against any repo
```

`just ci` runs exactly what CI runs: format check, clippy with warnings as errors, tests, and a
release build. Green there means green in CI.

`just smoke-edit` is the one check CI cannot run. It drives a real release binary through a pty
to test the `e` key: unit tests stop at the editor's argv, and everything past it is terminal
state. Run it after any change to `run_editor`, the terminal mode stack, or the editor dialects.
It takes about a minute.

To test a change inside real herdr panes, `just qa-install` swaps your build into the installed
plugin and `just qa-restore` brings the release back. The details and the sharp edges live in
`docs/qa-install.md`.

## How this repo works

**Specs are the contract.** New behavior is a change spec under
`docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/spec.md`, then a plan and tickets beside it. A behavior change
lands in that spec and the code together, in the same PR.

**The changelog is written as you go.** User-visible changes add a bullet under `## [Unreleased]`
in `CHANGELOG.md`. That text becomes the release notes verbatim, so write it for the person
reading the release page.

**Performance changes bring numbers.** The PTY benchmark measures what a user feels — keypress to
painted frame:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_tui.py --binary target/release/herdr-reviewr --fixture
```

The one committed baseline is `scripts/bench-results/baseline.json`. Replace it when a change
moves the numbers, and keep per-round A/B runs out of the tree. For anything touching the
reload, render, git, or highlight paths, run it before and after under the same system load and
put both numbers in the PR. `examples/bench_latency.rs` attributes a slow number to its
component calls.

## Pull requests

- Keep one PR to one concern.
- `just ci` green, change spec updated with the behavior, changelog bullet added.
- Tests live beside the code (unit) and in `tests/` (integration, against real git repos).
  Test names read as sentences: `a_tab_switch_paints_the_stashed_frame_and_defers_its_reload`.

## Releasing

Maintainers only — the process is `docs/RELEASING.md` in full. Short version: bump two versions,
finalize the changelog, tag `vX.Y.Z`, and CI builds the binaries and publishes the release with
the changelog section as its notes.
